extra residues: 
	1. hemes are split into porphyrin ring (including iron) and propionic acids: HEM, PRD, PRA (technical reason for titration in Karlsberg)
	-> they should form a sequence (1. PRA, 2. HEM, 3. PRD)
	-> protonated PRA/PRD via patch PRAH/PRA2 or PRDH/PRD2
	2. ligands of BNC:
	HOH: tip3p water model for CcO without H-H bond
	HAO2: ("half oxygen") single oxygen at heme
	OHMI: ("OH minus") hydroxyl ion
	OMI2: ("OH minus no. 2") hydroxyl ion (other atom type than OHMI, added for technical reasons)
	3. copper (included in some force fields already): CU1
	-> charges MUST be changed for all cofactors via Patches, initial charges are arbitrary!
